    <h1>Shakespeare's Sonnet #18</h1>
 
    <p>This is one of the most famous of the sonnets. It is referenced in the
        film Dead Poets Society and gave names to the band The Darling Buds and
        the book and television series The Darling Buds of May. Read it and
        weep!</p>
    

        <ul>
        <li>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</li>
        <li>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</li>
        <li>Rough winds do shake the darling bids of May,</li>
        <li>And summer's lease at all too short a date:</li>
        <li>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
        <li>Anf often is his gold complexion dimm'd, </li>
        <li>And very fair from fair sometime declines,</li>
        <li>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</li>
        <li>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</li>
        <li>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</li>
        <li>So long as men can breath, or eyes can see,</li>
        <li>so long live this, and this gives life to thee.</li>
    </ul>
